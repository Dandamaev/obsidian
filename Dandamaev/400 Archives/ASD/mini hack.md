The selection criteria are:
1. Ease of use and documentation.
2. Performance and scalability.
3. Ecosystem and community support.
4. Compatibility with {SPECIFIC_TECH_STACK}.

From the following frameworks, which two meet these criteria best? Please justify your choices:
{FRAMEWORK_LIST}
```

Example Filled Template:

```

#### Step 2: Evaluate and Select One Framework

Prompt Template:

```
Between {FRAMEWORK_1} and {FRAMEWORK_2}, which one would you recommend for the project? Provide a detailed justification considering:
1. Project complexity and learning curve.
2. Extensibility and plugin availability.
3. Long-term maintainability and ecosystem updates.
4. Specific features that align with the project's goals.
```

Example Filled Template:

```
Between Spring Boot and Micronaut, which one would you recommend for a project involving simplified OAuth setup and integration? Provide a detailed justification considering:
1. Project complexity and learning curve.
2. Extensibility and plugin availability.
3. Long-term maintainability and ecosystem updates.
4. Specific features that align with the project's goals.
```

### 2. Generate and Evaluate "Hello World" Examples

#### Step 1: Prompt to Generate "Hello World" Examples

Prompt Template:

```
Write a "Hello World" microservice example using {FRAMEWORK_NAME}. The example should:
1. Include setup instructions for a new project.
2. Define a single endpoint `/hello` that responds with "Hello, World!".
3. Include essential comments for learning purposes.
4. Use best practices for the framework.
```

Example Filled Template:

```
Write a "Hello World" microservice example using Spring Boot. The example should:
1. Include setup instructions for a new project.
2. Define a single endpoint `/hello` that responds with "Hello, World!".
3. Include essential comments for learning purposes.
4. Use best practices for the framework.
```

#### Step 2: Evaluate the Generated Examples

Prompt Template:

```
Compare the following two "Hello World" examples generated using {FRAMEWORK_1} and {FRAMEWORK_2}. Evaluate them based on:
1. Clarity and ease of understanding.
2. Adherence to best practices.
3. Ease of integration into a larger microservices architecture.
Which example is better, and why?
```

```

#### Step 3: Use the Best Example as a Learning Tool

Prompt Template:

```
Improve the selected "Hello World" example from {SELECTED_FRAMEWORK} by adding:
1. Basic logging.
2. Health check endpoint.
3. Configuration for deployment in a Docker container.
Provide detailed comments and instructions.
```

### Applying the Process

You can manually adapt these prompts to different frameworks and projects by filling the placeholders (`{GOAL_NAME}`, `{TECH_REQUIREMENT}`, etc.) to match your scenario. This approach ensures systematic evaluation and informed decisions.




### Comparison: Kong vs. Envoy Proxy

|Feature|**Kong**|**Envoy Proxy**|
|---|---|---|
|**Primary Role**|API Gateway with focus on plugin extensibility and OpenAPI validation.|High-performance edge proxy with advanced routing and observability.|
|**Kubernetes Integration**|Native support with Kong Ingress Controller; works well as a Kubernetes operator.|Seamless integration with Kubernetes; supports dynamic configuration with xDS APIs.|
|**OpenAPI Support**|Direct OpenAPI schema validation and auto-generation via plugins.|Supports OpenAPI indirectly through extensions or integration.|
|**Authentication (SSO)**|Built-in plugins for SSO, OAuth2, and JWT-based authentication.|Requires custom extensions or integrations for SSO and authentication.|
|**Routing Capabilities**|Enhanced request routing, weight-based load balancing, and caching via plugins.|Advanced routing and load balancing with dynamic configuration via APIs.|
|**Observability**|Moderate support with plugins for logging and monitoring.|Rich observability, including logging, metrics, and distributed tracing.|
|**Extensibility**|Plugin-based architecture; easy to customize and extend.|Flexible through APIs and extensions; highly configurable for complex use cases.|
|**Caching**|Response caching available via plugins.|Advanced caching and rate-limiting capabilities.|
|**Performance**|Well-suited for moderate traffic scenarios with customizable modules.|Optimized for high-performance, low-latency environments.|
|**Community and Ecosystem**|Mature and well-documented community support with an extensive plugin ecosystem.|Active and growing community; widely adopted in modern cloud-native architectures.|

### Recommendation for Your Project

For your **self-documenting API gateway with Kubernetes operator functionality**, **Kong** is the better fit:

1. **Native OpenAPI Support**: Kong's built-in OpenAPI validation and schema generation align directly with your requirement for auto-documentation.
2. **Authentication and SSO**: Its ready-to-use plugins for SSO, OAuth2, and JWT simplify implementing authorization features.
3. **Modular Deployment**: The plugin architecture makes it easier to integrate features like response caching, logging, and request validation without heavy customization.
4. **Kubernetes Integration**: The Kong Ingress Controller natively supports Kubernetes, making it easier to extend with custom CRDs for API schema definitions.

While Envoy excels in performance, observability, and dynamic configuration, it would require more effort to implement features like OpenAPI validation and SSO, making it less efficient for your specific goals.
