### **1. Ingress Reverse Proxy**

- **Description**: The reverse proxy forwards incoming traffic from external clients to the appropriate service within the Kubernetes cluster. The main role of the proxy is routing requests based on URL paths or subdomains.
- **Implementation**:
    - Integrate with the existing ingress controller (such as NGINX or Traefik).
    - Extend its functionality to handle traffic redirection, path-based routing, and load balancing.
    - Support for advanced routing rules (e.g., headers, request methods).
    - Configure the reverse proxy through Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) to dynamically update routing rules.
- **Key Considerations**:
    - Ensure the reverse proxy is resilient to failure and can handle high loads.
    - Focus on performance optimization for large traffic volumes.

### **2. Traffic Logging**

- **Description**: Logs all incoming requests and their corresponding responses. The logs should capture details like timestamps, source IPs, HTTP methods, request URLs, response times, and status codes.
- **Implementation**:
    - Implement log collection at the ingress point using tools like Fluentd or Elasticsearch.
    - Use the operator to configure which logs to capture, where to store them, and how long to retain them.
    - Make logs configurable via CRDs for filtering sensitive information (e.g., personal data).
- **Key Considerations**:
    - Ensure low overhead when logging to avoid degrading performance.
    - Logs should be encrypted if they contain sensitive information.

### **3. Load Balancing**

- **Description**: The operator should manage traffic distribution across multiple instances of a service to ensure scalability and fault tolerance.
- **Implementation**:
    - Integrate with Kubernetes' native load balancing mechanisms (e.g., Service or Endpoint resources).
    - Use round-robin, least connection, or other algorithms to distribute traffic.
    - Provide configuration options via CRDs to select the load-balancing strategy.
- **Key Considerations**:
    - Ensure that the load balancing mechanism can dynamically adapt to changing resource availability.
    - Provide health checks to monitor the health of upstream services and avoid sending traffic to unhealthy instances.

### **4. Single Sign-On (SSO)**

- **Description**: Integrate an SSO mechanism for user authentication, allowing users to sign in once and access multiple applications without re-entering credentials.
- **Implementation**:
    - Support popular protocols like OAuth2, OpenID Connect, or SAML for authentication.
    - Integrate with identity providers (e.g., Keycloak, Okta) and allow configuration through CRDs.
    - Store session tickets securely and manage them according to specified expiration rules (8 hours).
    - Use tokens (JWT or session cookies) for subsequent requests after login.
- **Key Considerations**:
    - Ensure secure transmission of tokens (e.g., via HTTPS).
    - Implement token validation to prevent replay attacks or expired tokens from being used.
    - Consider integration with role-based access control (RBAC) for authorization.

### **5. OpenAPI Schema Generation**

- **Description**: Automatically generate OpenAPI documentation (formerly Swagger) from the API’s source code, ensuring that the API is self-documenting.
- **Implementation**:
    - Extract API details such as endpoints, request/response formats, and validation rules directly from the source code or annotations.
    - Allow developers to define OpenAPI schemas as part of their service definitions.
    - Generate and serve the OpenAPI schema dynamically at runtime via the operator.
    - Use CRDs to allow API schema customization at the Kubernetes level (e.g., defining custom error messages, specifying versioning).
- **Key Considerations**:
    - Ensure that the schema generation is automatic but still allows developers to override specific details when necessary.
    - Validate that generated schemas are always in sync with the actual API behavior.

---

### **6. Request Validation**

- **Description**: Validate incoming API requests against a predefined schema (based on OpenAPI) before they reach the target service.
- **Implementation**:
    - Define validation rules using OpenAPI schemas in CRDs.
    - Implement validation middleware at the ingress point that checks each request’s body, headers, parameters, and query strings.
    - Reject invalid requests with proper error messages (400 Bad Request or 422 Unprocessable Entity).
    - Allow validation rules to be updated dynamically through CRDs.
- **Key Considerations**:
    - Focus on performance optimization, ensuring that validation doesn’t introduce significant latency.
    - Provide detailed error feedback to clients when requests fail validation.
    - Ensure validation logic covers all aspects of a request (including edge cases such as large payloads).

---

### **7. Response Caching**

- **Description**: Cache responses to reduce load on backend services and improve response times for frequently requested resources.
- **Implementation**:
    - Cache responses based on configurable rules (e.g., URL, query parameters, headers) via CRDs.
    - Set the cache expiration to 2 hours, allowing updates via configuration if needed.
    - Integrate cache invalidation mechanisms to ensure that cached content is not outdated.
    - Provide options to bypass the cache based on specific request headers (e.g., Cache-Control).
- **Key Considerations**:
    - Ensure the caching layer is optimized for high throughput and low latency.
    - Focus on cache coherency to avoid serving stale data.
    - Provide configurable options for cache size, invalidation policies, and timeouts.

---

### **Non-functional Requirements**

- **HTTP IPv4 Network Stack**: The operator will work over the IPv4 network stack, ensuring compatibility with existing infrastructure.
- **Session Ticket Usage**: Sessions should be managed securely using session tickets. The session expiration time is 8 hours, ensuring user sessions persist for an optimal period while still being secure.
- **Timeouts**: Response timeout should be set to 5 seconds. This ensures that requests are processed quickly, and any delay is handled gracefully by returning a proper error code.
- **Cache Expiration Time**: Cache expiration is set to 2 hours, optimizing performance while ensuring fresh data for frequently accessed resources.
