### Detailed Analysis

1. **Method 1 (ADT)**
    
    - **Pros**: Offers clear encapsulation of data and operations, making implementations easier when the interface is stable.
    - **Cons**: Changes in data representation necessitate updates in multiple places, which can lead to maintenance challenges.
    - **Conclusion**: Best suited for scenarios with stable data structures, although modifications may require considerable effort.

2. **Method 2 (Main/Subroutine)**
    
    - **Pros**: Facilitates straightforward implementation with a linear logic flow, making it easier to debug.
    - **Cons**: Adding new functions or changing existing ones can complicate the structure, leading to potential errors.
    - **Conclusion**: Works well for simpler tasks but may become unwieldy with increased complexity.

3. **Method 3 (Pipes-and-Filters)**
    
    - **Pros**: Each filter operates independently, allowing for easy modifications and replacements without affecting the entire system.
    - **Cons**: Performance may be impacted due to overhead from data passing, particularly in complex setups.
    - **Conclusion**: Ideal for modular systems where data transformations are necessary, although care must be taken regarding performance.

4. **Method 4 (Event-Driven)**
    
    - **Pros**: Offers flexibility in managing event handlers, allowing for scalable and modular designs.
    - **Cons**: Event management can introduce complexity, and the model might not always be performant without careful management.
    - **Conclusion**: Suitable for systems anticipating growth and change, offering flexibility in handling events.

### Overall Recommendations

- **Problem A (Key Word in Context)**: **Method 3 (Pipes-and-Filters)** is the most suitable choice. Its modular nature allows for easy updates and changes, which is advantageous in handling various data processing requirements without affecting the entire system. The independence of filters simplifies modifications and makes it easier to adapt the solution over time.

- **Problem B (Eight Queens)**: **Method 2 (Main/Subroutine)** is preferable due to its straightforward approach in implementing the backtracking algorithm typically used to solve the Eight Queens problem. The linear flow of the method makes it easier to understand and debug, allowing for effective handling of the recursive nature of the solution without unnecessary complexity. While it may face challenges with scalability, its clarity is an asset for this specific problem. 

In summary, Method 3 excels in modular applications requiring flexibility, while Method 2 provides simplicity and effectiveness for straightforward recursive algorithms. Method 1 is great for stable structures, albeit with modification challenges, and Method 4 offers scalability but may introduce complexity that is unwarranted for simpler tasks.
