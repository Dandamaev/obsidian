2. Responsibilities
3. UML2 for interactions + structured classifiers
### 1. What interactions are 
**Behavior** - is a specification of how instances change state over time.
**(architectural) Viewpoint** is a related set of aspects important for a stakeholder, view is a representation of the model at the viewpoint. Static (logical) viewpoint and dynamic viewpoint.
**View Model** - what are viewpoints to show the model
**Viewpoint:**
- Oxz
- Oxy
- Oyx
**4 + 1 Model**
- Logical (class diagram) - левый верхний 
- Dynamic (interactions) - правый верхний
- Implementation (component) - левый нижний
- Deployment - правый нижний
- + Use Case - центр
Classes Interactions Use cases diagram should be in one model
**Model:**
- ill-formed - syntax is not correct
- inconsistent - views are not consistent
